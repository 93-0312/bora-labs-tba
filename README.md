# Boralabs - TBA Project

## Introduction

BORAlabs - TBA Project is an Token Bound Account Standard project. We present a groundbreaking NFT market that
transcends traditional NFT trading by incorporating the ERC-1155 Multi Token Standard. This project introduces a
transformative feature, enabling the transfer of entire wallet (account) ownership through NFT trades. At its core, this
project introduces ERC-6551, Token Bound Accounts (TBA) Standard that are tightly connected to NFTs, allowing the
seamless transfer of all assets within an account during TBA trades. Join us as we explore these concepts, their
real-world applications, and reshape the landscape of blockchain asset ownership and management.
